# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING :
Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

# Pure functions
* Returns same result if given the same arguments.
* Produces no side effects


# Immutability
  * Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
  * When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value
