## Sending form data :
An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server.This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

# Client server architecture
At it’s most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.


# The GET method ..
  * The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: “Hey server, I want to get this resource.” In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
# The POST method ..
  * The POST method is a little different. It’s the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: “Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result.” If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
